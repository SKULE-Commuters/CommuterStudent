          Our Mission
          Commuting comes with its unique set of challenges, whether it be navigating through bus routes, spending hours in commute, or having more difficulty forming social circles. Our goal is to unite commuters around the campus and provide them with the necessary resources and aid needed to overcome these obstacles.
          
          What We Do
          We have created initiatives, such as the Commuter Buddy Program; a tool to help commuters who take similar routes form small groups, easing the journey. Additionally, we have monthly events. To learn more, check out the Events page.
