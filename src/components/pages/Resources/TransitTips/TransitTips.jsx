              "After your initial payment using your PRESTO card you can travel free of cost for the next two hours.",
              "You can load a Monthly Pass onto your PRESTO Card that will allow you as many TTC rides as your heart desires for $128.15 per month, plus the $5.25 student ID card they make you buy."

              "Don’t forget to set a default trip. If your PRESTO card has a default trip set for travel between two stations, you only have to tap on it. If you take a trip that begins or ends at a different station, you have to tap on and off.",
              "If you forget to tap off at the end of your trip, you will be charged the fare to the last stop on the line. You can always appeal a refund by filling out the webform on gotransit.com.",

              "Arrive at your destination at least 5 minutes before class starts.",
              "If you are commuting from Queen’s park, try to walk through Medical Science Building which will save you a solid 2-3 minutes each time.",
